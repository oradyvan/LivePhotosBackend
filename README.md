# LivePhotosBackend
Proof of concept of web services intended for handling Live Photos from Apple iOS devices.

The work is still in progress, the services are NOT yet ready, so please use at your own risk.

## Quick Start

1. Use Python 3 (`brew install python` on macOS High Sierra)
2. Set up virtual environment (`python -m venv env`)
3. Activate virtual environment (`source env/bin/activate`)
4. Install required Python modules (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Debug on Your Machine

This step is as simple as issuing console command `python server.py`. Then, you can navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
